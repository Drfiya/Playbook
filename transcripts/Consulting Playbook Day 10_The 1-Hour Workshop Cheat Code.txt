If you want a cheat code for creating tailored workshops, this is for you.
I recently generated an entire workshop deck at 11pm, and presented first thing the next day - the client had no idea it took 60 minutes (of which, I just dictated feedback for 10).
15 minutes on using Claude's deep research + docx generation to create fully customized workshop decks with client brand colors—and why "old-school" PowerPoint beats AI-looking Gamma slides for enterprise credibility.
What you'll watch:
- The 2-step Claude workflow: Research → Deck generation
- Real example: Serhant real estate company N8N automation deck (13 pages of research → 10-slide presentation)
- How to work around context window limits
- ChatGPT Enterprise workshop deck generated from scratch
- Why traditional PowerPoint format has "knowledge arbitrage" over Gamma

The 2-step workflow:
Step 1 - Deep Research (35 minutes):
Prompt given:
"Research the company Serhant and come up with a list of areas and/or departments where they may benefit from adding N8N automations in the business. Be specific and dive deeper into what opportunities in 2026 they may be able to tap into using these automations."
Used Claude's deep research feature (more comprehensive than normal search).
Trade-off: Deep research burns context window faster, so plan accordingly.
Step 2 - Synthesize to Docx:
Prompt: "Can you create a fully synthesized document based on your research that I could pass on to my team? Create a docx file that's well-formatted and has really easy-to-read sections."
Result: 13-page formatted document with:
- Executive summary
- Lead management automation opportunities
- Intelligent lead intake and enrichment
- Multi-channel lead responses
- Predictive lead scoring
- All the gold you need for deck creation
Why docx first? "Crystallize all research so I can take this document as context for new chat."
Context window workaround: Research in one chat → Export docx → Import to new chat for deck creation → Preserves tokens
The deck generation step:
New chat prompt:
"I want to create a full deck, ideally optimized to Serhant's (the real estate firm) brand colors. I want to put together a full 10-page deck walking through and explaining how they would use and apply N8N. I've attached a document with key opportunities. It's important we create a slide deck to educate them on the discovery, what N8N is, how it works at high level, and how they could benefit from it."
Added: Design instructions for how PowerPoint should look
What Claude did automatically:
1. Found Serhant logo online
2. Extracted brand colors (dark blue hex codes)
3. Applied branding throughout deck
4. Created 10 professional slides
The deck structure created:
Slide 1: Title with actual Serhant logo (didn't have to upload it)
Slide 2: What N8N is (open-source workflow automation platform)
Slide 3: How N8N works (triggers → actions → workflow)
Slide 4: Game-Changing Features (Text-to-Workflow, Agent Builder, 400+ integrations, Error Recovery)
Slide 5: Serhant's Key Automation Opportunities (specific to their business)
Slide 6: Implementation Strategy and Roadmap
Slide 7: Expected ROI and Benefits (detailed breakdown)
Quality: "This is an example of a slide I would literally create myself, and it would probably not look as good, especially if I didn't use something like Gamma."
The ChatGPT Enterprise workshop example:
Different use case: Generic workshop deck (not company-specific)
Prompt given:
"Research all the latest and greatest features in ChatGPT that an enterprise interested in real estate would care about as of October 2025. Do full research on whether it's YouTube channels, OpenAI's website, all the features in ChatGPT that they would care about."
Time anchoring: "October 2025" tells Claude to prioritize sources from that time period
"I purposely gave a very crappy prompt to show you it will take all the heavy lifting."
What Claude found:
- GPT-5 launch (August 2025)
- Atlas browser (days old)
- Apps in ChatGPT
- Company Knowledge feature (shared RAG resource for Teams plan)
- Zillow app integration with connectors
Initial request: 20 pages (topped out context window)
Adjusted: 10 pages (moved research to new chat for more room)
The resulting deck structure:
Slide 1: Workshop goals
Slide 2: ChatGPT Enterprise overview
Slide 3: Features of ChatGPT Enterprise
Slide 4: GPT-5 intelligence (core facts about the model)
Slide 5-6: Company Knowledge feature (benefits, what it does, why it matters)
Slide 7: "Built for Real Estate" (Zillow app integration, example queries)
Slide 8: Competitive advantage of using ChatGPT
Slide 9: Enterprise security
Slide 10: Real estate use cases at a glance
All tailored to real estate industry automatically.

The knowledge arbitrage principle:
Old-style PowerPoint vs Gamma-style slides:
Gamma aesthetic: "People of the old world see Gamma and think: 'Oh, this is AI-generated stuff. You probably didn't put in the work.'"
Traditional PowerPoint aesthetic: "Things might not be as shiny and beautiful, but structured in a way enterprises and businesses have been used to. They'll think you did this pretty much all yourself."
Two wins:
1. Cheat time (1 hour instead of 8-10 hours)
2. Display yourself in best way possible (looks like manual effort)
Knowledge arbitrage = AI-generated content that doesn't look AI-generated
When to use this workflow:
Paid workshop prep: Client-specific decks in 1 hour
Free webinar strategy: "If starting out, cheat code is doing things for free. Session on ChatGPT, Claude AI, anything—super helpful."
Last-minute presentations: 11pm to midnight → ready for 9am delivery
RFP responses: Show deep company knowledge fast
Discovery call follow-ups: "Here's what I researched about your company"
The prep-to-delivery ratio transformation:
Old way:
- Manual company research: 3-4 hours
- Synthesize findings: 2 hours
- Design deck: 3-4 hours
- Format and polish: 1-2 hours
- Total: 9-12 hours
New way:
- Claude deep research: 35 minutes (automated)
- Generate docx: 5 minutes
- Generate deck: 15 minutes
- Review and tweak: 5 minutes
- Total: 1 hour
Time savings: 8-11 hours per deck
How to extend this for different industries:
Real estate: N8N automations, ChatGPT listings, AI property analysis
Financial services: Compliance automation, risk analysis workflows
Healthcare: Patient intake automation, appointment workflows
E-commerce: Inventory management, customer service automation
Legal: Document review, case research automation
Just change the company name and industry focus in prompts.
Pro tips for best results:
1. Use deep research when possible (more comprehensive, burns context faster)
2. Always include time anchor ("as of October 2025") to prioritize recent sources
3. Export research to docx before deck generation to preserve context window
4. Specify brand colors or let Claude find them automatically
5. Start with 10 slides, extend to 20-30 after initial generation if needed
6. Give specific page count to avoid context window errors
7. For paid clients: Always review and add personal touches (but 80% is done)
Common mistakes to avoid:
→ Don't try to do everything in one chat (context window will die)
→ Don't use Gamma-style if presenting to traditional enterprise audience
→ Don't skip the research docx step (you'll need it for reference)
→ Don't forget to specify industry/audience (generic decks are weak)
→ Don't present without reviewing (Claude occasionally hallucinates features)
The competitive advantage:
Most consultants: Spend days researching and building custom decks
You: 1 hour from research to final deck
Your client: Thinks you spent days on their custom presentation
The value perception stays high while your time investment drops 90%.
Why this matters for consulting business:
→ Lets you take on more clients (1 hour vs 10 hours per deck)
→ Last-minute opportunities become possible (11pm request → 9am delivery)
→ Free workshops become viable (low time investment for lead generation)
→ Proposal quality increases (every prospect gets custom deck)
→ You can test new industries without massive prep overhead
